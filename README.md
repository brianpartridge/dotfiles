# dotfiles

## Description

These are my dotfiles for work and play environments.

## Usage

- Clone to ~/dotfiles.
- Symlink ~/.bash_profile, ~/.vimrc, ~/.gvimrc, ~/.gitconfig to the files in ~/dotfiles.
- Symlink any other shared configs, scripts, etc.
- When a change is made in one environment, push it to the remote so other environments can sync up.

See rtrss-README.md for more info on using rtrss.py.

## License

None - Use them to make your life better.
