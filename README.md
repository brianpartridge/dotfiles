# dotfiles
## About
These are my dotfiles for work and play environments.  This should be a private repository because some work settings may be confidential.

## Usage
- Checkout to ~/dotfiles.
- Symlink ~/.bash_profile, ~/.vimrc, ~/.gvimrc, ~/.gitconfig to the files in ~/dotfiles.
- Symlink any other shared configs, scripts, etc.
- When a change is made in one environment, push it to the remote so other environments can sync up.
